i About
-------

ini is a Objective-C Package for parsing INI Files.
It uses the Foundation Framework provided in NeXT/OpenStep, Rhapsody,
Mac OS X and GNUStep.

ii Compilation
--------------

At the shell prompt, simply type:

	# make

To clean-up the directory, type:

	# make clean

iii Linking against INIParser
-----------------------------

You need to directly link against the Object Files and the Foundation Framework.
An ar(1) Archive could not be build, because the resulting binary will
simply not work (don't know why).
